# Exercises

Update your answers to the following questions, make sure to commit this file and your improved code as well!


## Task 1 - oop.py

1. Is MObject an abstract or a concrete class? Explain why:
	- *edit your response*
	concrete class. python module abc is not imported and there's no decorator as @abstractmethod

1. The 'Image' class has commented code for a `__del__` method. What does this commented-out method do?
	- *edit your response*
	destructor. This method is callend when an object is garbage collected.

1. What class does Texture inherit from?
	- *edit your response*
	Image class

1. What methods and attributes does the Texture class inherit from 'Image'? 
	- *edit your response*
	Subclass can inherit every public attributes and methods in Image(parent) class.

1. Do you think a texture should have a 'has-a' (composition) or 'is-a'(inheritance) relationship with 'Image'? If you think it is a 'has-a' relationship, refactor the code. As long as you defend your decision in the response below it could be either--but defend your position well!
	- *edit your response*
	has-a relationship. 'An image has a texture' makes more sense.

1. I did not declare a constructor for Texture. Does Python automatically create constructors for us? 
	- *edit your response*
	python automatically creates a default constructor.

## Task 2 - Singleton

1. Refactor the singleton.py file such that:
  - The first time the logger is constructed, it will print out:
  	-  `Logger created exactly once`
  - If the logger is already initialized, it will print:
  	-  `logger already created`
Note: You do not 'have' a constructor, but you construct the object in the *instance* member function where you will create an object.  
Hint: Look at Lecture 3 slides for an example of creating a Singleton in Python

1. Are singleton's in Python thread safe? Why or why not?

*edit the code directly* 
not thread-safe. If there are 2 threads, it might be possible the first thread is creating
the singleton instance but thread 2 might also does the same before the first instance was stored.
